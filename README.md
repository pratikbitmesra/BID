# BID
Bulk I/O Dispatch, i.e. BID Schemes. We have designed and developed two contention avoidance storage solutions, collectively known as BID: Bulk I/O Dispatch, for multiplexing Big Data environments like Hadoop MapReduce. BID-HDD is a disk scheduling scheme. BID-Hybrid is another contention avoidance scheme using hybrid tiers of storage for improving HDD performance using SSDs. In this project we have designed system simulators to emulate the behavior of the applications (using traces), Operating System or more specifically the OS block layer of the system, Virtual File System, as well as the storage devices, taking the input as traces from blktrace.

BID-HDD has been published as Mishra, P., Mishra, M., Somani, A.K.: Bulk i/o storage management for big data applications. In: Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium On, pp. 412{417 (2016). IEEE. While BID-Hybrid and BID-HDD are submitted in Journal version. 

A part of the code for the simulator is available as per now.
Main code would be uploaded once permission is sought from the technical society.
